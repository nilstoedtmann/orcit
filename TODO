TODO:
 * Add support for OTR (http://python-otr.pentabarf.de/)
 * Split orcit.py into a modul providing a stream or socket, and an example client using STDIN/OUT
 * Handle IRC exceptions, e.g. nick collisions
 * Use source nick of first incoming private message as "target"
 * Use a logging module for status messages
 * Client: write log/status messages to STDERR
 * Have a queue of messages which could not yet been sent because we are not yet logged in or do not know the target yet
 * irclib2.py: handle the case of IPv6 + SOCKS properly
 * irclib2.py: file SOCKS support patch at http://python-irclib.sourceforge.net/
 * Instead of patching irclib, monkey-patch socket.socket()
 * Documentation
